# Starting new prototypes

This guide covers setting up new PatternFly prototypes using AI-assisted development tools.

## Project setup

For new prototypes, we recommend using the **patternfly-react-seed** application as your starting point. This seed application comes pre-configured with:

- A basic PatternFly React application structure
- The **patternfly-ai-coding tool** already integrated and ready to use
- Essential dependencies and build configuration
- Example components and patterns to reference

The patternfly-react-seed provides an optimal foundation for [vibe coding](/patternfly-ai/rapid-prototyping/rapid-prototyping#what-is-vibe-coding) because the AI tools can immediately access PatternFly context and guidance through the embedded patternfly-ai-coding tool.

## Getting the seed application

1. Clone or download the patternfly-react-seed repository
2. Install dependencies according to the project's README
3. Start the development server
4. Begin prototyping with your AI development tools

## Workflow steps

1. **Set up your project**: Start with the PatternFly seed application that includes the AI coding tool
2. **Define your prototype scope**: Clearly articulate what you want to build using [vibe coding principles](/patternfly-ai/rapid-prototyping/rapid-prototyping#effective-prompting-with-vibe-coding) - describe the experience, not the technical implementation
3. **Leverage AI assistance**: Use AI tools to generate PatternFly components based on your requirements, communicating through natural language descriptions of user needs and design intent
4. **Iterate and refine**: Review generated code and make adjustments as needed, continuing to use vibe coding to guide refinements
5. **Test and validate**: Ensure your prototype meets design and functional requirements
