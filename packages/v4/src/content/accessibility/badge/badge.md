A **badge** is used to annotate other information like a label or an object name. Badges are typically used to reflect counts, like number of unread notifications. Badges are not interactive.

**Keyboard users** should not be able to focus on a badge.

**Screen reader users** should be able to have a screen reader describe the contents of and purpose of a badge when it pops up, but not focus on it otherwise.

No props need to be added or modified for badge accessibility.

As a caution, badges can be styled using a variety of colors. Relying on color alone to communicate information causes barriers to 
access for many readers: colorblind and low vision users may not be able to perceive the color differences, and screen 
readers do not announce colors to non-sighted readers.
